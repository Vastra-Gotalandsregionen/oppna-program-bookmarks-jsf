# Bookmarks #

The bookmarks portlet allows users to add bookmarks to other webpages for their personal usage in the portal. Each bookmark can have a customized title, url and a description.

Also, the portlet will display links to the user's specific intranet sites. Which sites a user should see is determined by values retrieved from an Expando attribute on the user. The value of this attribute is populated depending on what roles and groups a user belongs to (this logic does not belong to this project, however).

The project is based on the [reference architecture](https://code.google.com/p/oppna-program/wiki/Introduktion_till_RA) of Region Västra Götaland (in Swedish). The portlet has been developed for and tested on Liferay EE 6.0.12.
